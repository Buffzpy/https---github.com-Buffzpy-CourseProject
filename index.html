    <p><span class="p1">Today I am going to talk about 3 programming languages
    necessary for web development. HTML, JAVASCRIPT and CSS are the 3 languages that are used to make a website.

    <h2 ><span class="headings">HTML</span>
    </h2>
    <p><span class="p1">TML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
        It is a standard markup language for web page creation. 
        It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements 
        (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes. 
        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely: Web development.</span></p>

<h3><span class="headings">CSS</span></h3>


<p><span class="p1">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, 
    is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
     CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this 
     independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look:
     it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look 
     however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
    While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides 
    powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</span></p>

<h4><span class="headings">JAVASCRIPT</span></h4>
<p><span class="p1">JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. 
    It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements 
    to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is
     based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
